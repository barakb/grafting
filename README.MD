[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/barakb/grafting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/barakb/grafting)

My golang raft implementation.

Grafting is after [queen rearing grafting](http://www.nsqba.com/graftingtipsinfo.html)

For now state machine is `map[string]interface{}`

TCP transport is not written yet.

See sample usage in the file [servers_test.go](https://github.com/barakb/grafting/blob/master/servers_test.go)
